NAME
    metatrans - Perl/Tk frontend to MetaTrans

SYNOPSIS
        metatrans

CONFIGURATION
    A configuration file of following structure is expected in
    "/etc/metatrans.conf" or in "$HOME/.metatrans".

        # plug-ins to be used
        <modules>
          # for example
          add MetaTrans::SlovnikCz
          add MetaTrans::SeznamCz
          add MetaTrans::SmsCz
          add MetaTrans::WordbookCz
          add MetaTrans::UltralinguaNet
        </modules>

        # default language to translate from
        lang_from = eng

        # default language to translate to
        lang_to   = ger

        # should the matching be done at word boundaries only?
        # this is a default value (can be changed in "Filtering options")
        at_bounds = 1

        # default matching type (see help in "Filtering options")
        # 1 = exact match
        # 2 = match at start
        # 3 = match exprression
        # 4 = match words
        # 5 = no filtering
        matching  = 5

        # timeout in seconds
        timeout   = 15

    After the first run the "~/.metatrans" is automatically overwritten to
    take into account configuration changes made during apllication run.
    This deletes all comments and makes the configuration file structure bit
    ugly.
